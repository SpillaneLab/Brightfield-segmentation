# Brightfield segmentation
Fiji macro to segment on the brightfield channel.
# Overview 
This macro segments on the brightfield channel (Figure 1) and references a signalling channel e.g., calcium (used in this example), to obtain information like mean fluorescence intensity. Brightfield segmentation should only be used as a last resort when membrane staining is unavailable, as is often poorer in comparison. <br/> <br/>

# Installation 
Analysis performed using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012).
1.	Copy the code (from browser or download as .txt) and paste into macro window as: 
     Plugins > New > Macro
2.	Ensure the language is set to IJ1 Macro in the Language tab of the macro window. 
3.	Save the macro using .ijm extension. 
# How to use 
1.	Adjust the method of segmentation and channel to be referenced as required
